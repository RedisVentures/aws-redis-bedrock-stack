# Redis Enterprise Cloud Setup

## Goal
The goal is to deploy Redis Enterprise Cloud as your vector database for AWS Bedrock on the AWS Marketplace. You will create a flexible, pay-as-you-go subscription. If you are new to Redis, **we even give you a 14-day free trial of $500 USD to get started!**

[ TODO - BEDROCK UI REDIS DEPLOYMENT LINK SCREENSHOT]

Link directly from the Bedrock configuration screen seen above, or manually [follow this link] to the AWS Marketplace offering to get started.

## Setup Steps

Once on the landing page, continue to click on `View purchase options`.

This navigates you to the sign-in page of `Redis Enterprise Cloud` web console.

As soon as you sign in , you will see that your `AWS Account` ( example: `Srini 1320974`) is displayed and you will be able to connect this AWS account with Redis Enterprise Cloud web console.
Go ahead and check the selection box highlighted.

Go ahead and select your `Region` and give `Subscription name` a name.

Choose a `Region` and a `CIDR`, like what is shown below.

<img width="1288" alt="bedrock-redis-rc-12" src="https://github.com/RedisVentures/aws-redis-bedrock-stack/assets/6223831/68ac390f-559a-489b-a62f-a3d5216c27f9">

Simply choose default values here.

On the `Sizing` tab, click on `+` button to add a new database.

<img width="1290" alt="bedrock-redis-rc-14" src="https://github.com/RedisVentures/aws-redis-bedrock-stack/assets/6223831/5214845a-d3c6-49c1-b3d1-7eec57059876">

Give your `database` a name and select `RediSearch` and `RedisJSON` modules.

<img width="1288" alt="bedrock-redis-rc-15" src="https://github.com/RedisVentures/aws-redis-bedrock-stack/assets/6223831/6d449812-b920-4f5e-9f59-cb0e7878df3d">

Depending upon the total number of documents you intend to use in your vector database, you will need to start with a specific data size for your applications. For this exercise, use the approximate sizing table below to help pick a starting point (which you can always adjust up or down later on). Alternatively, you can select a simple minimalistic configuration for now (example: Memory = 1 GB and Throughput Shards = 1).

| Number of Documents | Db size w/out replication (no HA) | Db size w/ replication (HA) |

| TODO  | TODO  | TODO  |

Once you review the total cost price, and other details, simply click on the `Create subscription` button to create `Redis Enterprise Cloud Flexible` subscription.

<img width="1288" alt="bedrock-redis-rc-22" src="https://github.com/RedisVentures/aws-redis-bedrock-stack/assets/6223831/f0581b95-a855-46ca-a11f-2eeed535f3d4">

The actual subscription creation may take approximately 5 mins to 15mins.

<img width="1288" alt="bedrock-redis-rc-23" src="https://github.com/RedisVentures/aws-redis-bedrock-stack/assets/6223831/e8c82094-81cd-4c06-b519-50dd0bad44fe">

Once the subscription is created, you will see that it is ready with a Green amber light on in the `Status` column.

<img width="1288" alt="bedrock-redis-rc-24" src="https://github.com/RedisVentures/aws-redis-bedrock-stack/assets/6223831/36af6ccf-a789-46eb-913e-24f354eee3df">

If you click on the database, the database configuration screen shows that the TLS is turned off by default. Click on Edit button to edit the details.

<img width="1288" alt="bedrock-redis-rc-25" src="https://github.com/RedisVentures/aws-redis-bedrock-stack/assets/6223831/3dfae120-a999-450b-a6ed-74260f84e37b">

Go ahead and turn on the TLS (`annotation 1`), disable `TLS client authentication` (`annotation 2`) and download the server certification (`annotation 3`).
Finally `Save the database` (`annotation 4`)

<img width="1288" alt="bedrock-redis-rc-28" src="https://github.com/RedisVentures/aws-redis-bedrock-stack/assets/6223831/43b222c0-cd89-48b2-b882-03507ecd019d">

Redis Enterprise Cloud on AWS is now ready for your use. Typically, the developers need an endpoint , a user password and the server certificate to connect to the database from their applications.

Redis web console also gives you code snippets on how to connect from different clients. Choose the one that is appropriate to your client applications.

Like mentioned above, here is how you can get the password to your Redis database.

### Summary
In essence, you will spin a Redis Enterprise Cloud cluster in AWS and once this subscription is provisioned, you will need the following details for your database, for your client applications to connect to.

```
Redis Enterprise Cloud Database Hostname
Redis Enterprise Cloud Database Port Number
Redis Enterprise Cloud Database Password
Redis Enterprise Cloud Database Server certification for TLS
```
